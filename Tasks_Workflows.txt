Setup -
My PC is windows so had to work in wsl terminal during dev to be compatible with dcmtk 

Docker Build
Issues - permissions error on /var/lib/postgresql/data
Solved - adding as a volume outside the services 
Occurred on both docker builds

Tasks -
0. change .gitignore 
Issues - 
Given I was working in wsl, when trying to remove venv from .gitignore, I had an OS compatibility error 
"warning: in the working copy of 'venv/bin/activate', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it"   
Due to the venv file setup being in a Linux folder structure

1. SQL Query
Steps taken -
1. setup csc db in pgadmin on web interface
2. select query on radiology.report, joining patient.demographics and radiology.order_tbl on primary keys to avoid duplication and  the applying where conditions

Extension to python script - 
1. connect to db using psycopg2
2. open connection with conn.cursor
3. set query variable
4. execute query cursor.execute(query)
5. fetch query result cursor.fetchall()
6. save results

2. Process data from XNAT
Full task was not completed within the 4 hour time limit

Data flow 
1. Pull subject from XNAT
2. Download subject files 
3. loop over DICOM files completed processing 
4. create new session folder within subject folder
5. save new DICOM files to new session folder 
6. push subject back to XNAT with new session

Dataflow completed up to step 5 within time limit

Code explanation -

Packages used - xnat, pydicom, os

Planned coding workflow -
1. Use XNAT python package to connect to XNAT web
2. select project
3. select subject (chosen subject = 'GSTT000030')
4. download subject directory
5. loop over files in directory
	5.1 apply functions add_day_to_tags, remove_tag_val, change_study_desc to DICOM files 
	5.2 Create new folder with SessionA as session value within subject folder
	5.3 Save each DICOM file to new folder maintain the same folder structure as original session

Planned next steps to be taken - 
1. zip new session folder 
2. Push to XNAT using python XNAT import_ 
3. Refactor new session folder construction to function reconfigure_subject_session  
4. Create clean up function to delete files from dev_data folder after pushed back to XNAT

Issues - 
- unable to push to XNAT using xnatpy import_ method
Proposed Solution - 
mimic method used in project setup steps for proposed method 

Proposed changes to workflow given issues -
1. Create function to change (0010,4000) to new session value 
2. During DICOM processing loop use new function to change (0010,4000) for all DICOM values  
3. Push using 'storescu +sd -r -aec XNAT localhost 8104 {directory_path}' command

 

3. Add orthanc as service to docker_compose.yml file 

To do this I followed the instructions on the https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/users/docker.html
